
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of text sentiment classification on movie reviews using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python. The notebook showcases how to preprocess text data, extract features, train various classifiers, and evaluate their performance.

## Key Components

- **Feature Extraction**: Using word tokenization and part-of-speech tagging to extract features from text.
- **Classifier Training**: Training multiple classifiers, e.g. Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the accuracy performance of each classifier.
- **Voting Classifier**: Implementing a voting model that combines the multiple classifiers to improve prediction accuracy.

## How to Use

To run the notebook, you need to install the necessary Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`. Ensure you have a Python environment (version 3.6 or newer) set up before proceeding.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AnnaTz/sentiment-classification-nltk
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
   ```
   cd sentiment-classification-nltk
   ```
3. Install the required packages by running:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
After installing the dependencies, you can open the Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code) and run the cells in order to see the sentiment analysis process in action.
